# Farms to Freeways demo 

The example notebook shows how to load data from LDaCA API and run some analysis.


To use this notebook,

1) Sign into the [ATAP data portal](https://data.atap.edu.au) and get an API key from your [User Info](https://data.atap.edu.au/user) page. You may need to authenticate and request access via REMS first (TODO more info about this).


2) Open the notebook in the ATAP BinderHub by clicking the `launch` button below.

3) In the JupyterHub interface, edit `vars.env` file and add the API_KEY. An example is shown below of the required format.
   
```env
API_KEY=153b2db8-4536-4016-8bd6-311e8817e764
```

4) After adding the key, restart the notebook kernel to make the env variable available for the notebook.
