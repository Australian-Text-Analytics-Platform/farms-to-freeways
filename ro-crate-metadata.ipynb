    "The value \"c 1924\" needs to be normalised as a regular looking year, ie 4 numbers in a sequence. This can be done by simply only allowing the last 4 characters in any string that is a birthDate. For example if year0 = \"1918\" and year1 = \"c 1924\" and we only take the last 4 characters, then year0[-4:] = \"1918\" and year1[-4:] = \"1924\".\n",

This conversion can be done by 'type casting', eg, if year is a string that has the value \"1924\", we simply impose the type int(), such as int(year), so the string year = \"1924\" => integer, year = 1924, which is then a number (not a string) that can undergo maths operations.\n",
